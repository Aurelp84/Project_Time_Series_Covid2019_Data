Hello

the files.zip contains:

zip for Python project : 

	- Notebook (.ipynb) (executed with Jupyter Notebook)
	- PDF version of the Notebook


zip for R project : 

	- Rmarkdown (.rmd) (executed with Rstudio)
	- PDF version of the Notebook
	- HTML of the Rmarkdown (better visualization)
	

It's possible that you have to install or update some packages to compil the files.

Best regards
